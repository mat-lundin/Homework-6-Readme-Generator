# E-Commerce Backend

## Description
  This project was to build the backend of an E-Commerce application. We built models for 3 tables and their relationships. We created routers for each type of request for each table: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

## Installation
To install, download the repository files and run ```npm i``` in the terminal from the root folder to install all dependencies. The database will need to be created and seeded by running the ```schema.sql``` file in MySQL and then running ```npm run seed``` in the terminal.

## Usage
To use, run ```npm start``` in the terminal. The server will start up and the user will be able to make requests to the server to manipulate the data in the database (using Insomnia for instance).
